# Incremental Game Template

# THIS IS ENTIRELY WIP, IF YOU RANDOMLY STUMBLE INTO THIS, HOPE THAT I WILL MANAGE TO FINISH THIS

TODO: Write readme

To get started:

-   `npm i` (installs required packages)
-   `npm run tailwind` (creates an initial tailwind_cenerated.css)
-   `npm run dev` (runs the game locally)

If you want to stop the local game from running, just press CTRL+C (in mac probably CMD+C).
If you want to run it again, you only need to do `npm run dev`
